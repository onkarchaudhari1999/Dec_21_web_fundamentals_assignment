        <p id="para1">There where about seventy of us kids growing up on Andrew Street in the block between Main and
            Lindhorst Streets, but there were rguments as to the actual number.
            So we counter, more than once. There were twenty or so kids in arms and carriages, about twelve between five
            and eleven,
            fifteen around twelve and fourteen, and the rest fifteen to twenty and some of those who were married with a
            kid.
            But we were not sure of that breakdown.Every time the toral number was
            always different! So we decided to agree, and fter much debate, agreed
            that the number was seventy!

        <p class="content">Andrew Street was located in the suburb of Kenilworth about fifteen
            miles south from the center of Johannesburg. It was tree-lined on bot
            ides with eight-foot wide sandy sidewalks and the tarmac street was

            uurbs of Johannesburg, a large area of land, maybe twenty square miles,
            consisted of slightly rolling hills and valleys. There always seemed to be

            gradient of some sort; very seldom could you find level ground. Al
            the big buildings, like schools, were built on banks, built-up ground, o1
            graded hills, as were the tennis courts, soccer, cricket, and rugby fields.</p>
        <p class="content">World War II was raging and there seemed to be little food and
            no money. To bolster nutrition, all kids were forced to drink milk and
            at caramel candies supplied by the school. We hated the candy, it gave
            ‘ou the same feeling as when you had to take Epsom salts or eat cab-

            age! Photos were taken of kids, and nurses stuck sticks on our tongues,
            Jooked down our throats, examined our chests and measured pulse rates,
